# Leet Code Reimagined
Rolling my own leetcode cuz I'm tired of doing actual leetcode problems.

## Feature
- Easily deploy offline and practice via docker compose
- Duolingo style design
  - Streaks + Friend Streaks
  - Easy to select individual problems or a category of problems
  - Easy to just find a new problem to work on or review weak areas
- Fast execution with low latency

### TODO

- easy offline practice via docker compose
